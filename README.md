# Security Control Assessment – Google Cybersecurity Certificate (Course 2)

This is a sample **Security Control Assessment (SCA)** created as part of Course 2: *Foundations of Cybersecurity* from the [Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate](https://grow.google/certificates/cybersecurity/).

## Overview
The goal of this SCA is to evaluate and document the effectiveness of selected security controls for a sample system based on key cybersecurity frameworks such as:
NIST SP 800-53 (Rev. 5)
CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)
This project simulates what an entry-level analyst might do when assessing risk and ensuring organizational compliance with security policies.


## Scope

- **System Type:** [Botium Toys]
- Controls Assessed:
- Access control
- Audit and accountability
- Risk assessment
- Incident response
- **Assessment Type:** Basic qualitative analysis based on mock data

---

## Methodology

1. Identified relevant controls using NIST SP 800-53
2. Documented potential risks to the system based on known threats
3. Assessed the current state of controls (implemented, partially implemented, not implemented)
4. Provided mitigation recommendations to reduce risk


## Key Skills Demonstrated

- Understanding of the CIA Triad and NIST frameworks
- Ability to map security threats to control gaps
- Documentation of technical and non-technical security controls
- Entry-level risk assessment methodology
